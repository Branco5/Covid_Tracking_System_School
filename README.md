# Covid_Tracking_System_School

In this project I developed a java program that uses random code generation to track covid in a school. 
Professors would be responsible for registering students in a class and their respective position in the classroom, at which point the system would generate new random id’s for every individual in the room, exchange these id’s between everyone present and register the respective distances. 
Users could check their status to see if they came into contact with an infected user in the last few days, upon which they would be recommended preventive measures according to the distance they were from the infected user.
